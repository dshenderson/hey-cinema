# hey cinema

This is a coding challenge for HeyCar.

## Requirements

Create a semantic, user-friendly page in React with the following:

1. The basic heycinema header, as seen in the styleguide
2. A search bar that takes a string and calls the OMDb search endpoint on submit
3. A list of search results, displayed as tiles, showing each resultâ€™s:
  * image
  * name
  * rating
  * and year of release
4. Loading and error states

Your app should be mobile-friendly, and take extensibility, maintainability, and state management into consideration.

## To Do List

This really is a basic app. Sadly, given a lack of spare time, I skipped over a few things:

* There is a distinct lack of testing, which bugs me to no end. I should have implemented tests first, but instead I
  just haven't been able to get to it. If required, I will add them later.

* At the moment I am only showing 1 page of results. It would be nice to have pagination.

* I haven't added any CTAs. At the very least, each result should have a link to see more details, as there is a lot
  of information returned in the API which would be cool to see.

* It would be good to implement an Advanced Search which allows the user to specify any of title, type (movie, series,
  or episode), year, or plot (short or full), and perhaps also to filter the results by any number of criteria.

## Installation

To start the application:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
